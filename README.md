# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot

Obstacle Detection and Avoidance can be considered as the central issue in 
designing mobile robots. This technology provides the robots with **Senses** 
which it can use to traverse in Unfamiliar Environments without damaging 
itself. An Obstacle Avoiding Robot can **Detect obstacles in its path and 
Maneuver around them without making any collision**. It is a robot vehicle 
that works on **Arduino Microcontroller** and employs **Ultrasonic Distance 
Sensors** to detect obstacles. The Arduino board was selected as the 
microcontroller platform and its software counterpart, Arduino Software, 
was used to carry out the programming. The integration of ultrasonic sensor 
module provides higher accuracy in detecting surrounding obstacles.

## Applications
1. It can be used in **Dangerous Environments** where human can’t Operate like **Underground Mine**.
2. It can be used  to Navigate in **Unknown Environment** by avoiding collision.
3. It can also execute its proper function in **Dark places** as it detects obstacle by Sonar.
4. It can work as a **Spy** if a camera is attached to it.
5. It can avoid collision from **Front side As well as Right & Left side**.
